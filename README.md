## (H.A.H) || Home Away from Home
**Solo Review Project**
## Summary:
- Turing students anticipate getting a job after graduation,
- So I decided that my API pull would be from something useful!
- Welcome to H.A.H. where you can search jobs based on keyword, date, location, or category. As well as keep track of your submitted applications and interviews
